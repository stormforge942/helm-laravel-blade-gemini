                respect thereto at the time of disclosure; (e) is independently developed by the receiving Party without
                use of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; or (f) is approved in writing for release or
                disclosure by the disclosing Party without restriction. A disclosure by one Party of Confidential

                Party’s cost, if the other Party wishes to contest the disclosure. Nothing in this Section 5 prevents
                Local Spark from identifying Customer as a customer of Local Spark to its investors or in a listing of
                other Local Spark customers.</p>

                consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and, absent such consent,
                any attempted assignment or delegation will be null, void and of no effect. Notwithstanding the
                foregoing, either Party may freely assign this Agreement in its entirety (including all Order Forms
                and/or SOWs), upon notice and without the consent of the other Party, to its successor in connection
                with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets.

                13.6 Severability :
            </h3>
            <p>
                Whenever any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable for any reason in any jurisdiction,
                such provision will be construed as having been adjusted to the minimum extent necessary to cure such
                invalidity or unenforceability. It will not be the case, circumstance, or jurisdiction of any other
                case, circumstance, or jurisdiction that the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision in this
                Agreement will render such provision invalid or unenforceable, or that any other provision of this
                Agreement will become invalid or unenforceable.

                13.7 Waiver :
            </h3>
            <p>
                Under this Agreement, no waiver will be valid or binding unless it is in writing and duly executed by
                the
                Party against whom enforcement is sought. Waivers of this kind will constitute waivers only with respect
                to the specific matter described therein and will not harm the rights of the party granting the waiver
                at any other time or in any other respect. By delaying or forbearing in exercising any right under this
                Agreement, neither Party will be deemed to have waived that right.

                13.8 Force Majeure :
            </h3>
            <p>
                If a party is prevented or delayed in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement because of
                circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including, by way of example, war, riot, fires, floods,
                epidemics, or failure of public utilities or public transportation systems, such failure or delay will
                not be deemed a breach of this Agreement, but such obligation will remain in full force and effect and
                will be performed or satisfied as soon as reasonably practicable after the termination of the relevant
                circumstances causing such failure or delay, provided that if such Party is prevented or delayed from
                performing for more than ninety (90) days, the other Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30)
                days written notice.
